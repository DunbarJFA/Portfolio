GroceryTracker.java  is  an  application  that  models  a  grocery  list  app  using  objects  of  the  GroceryList class  made  in  GroceryList.java.  

The app takes a single command-line argument, the name of the file to save/load from. The filename can be absolute or relative.  (If  the  given  file  does  not  exist,  a  new  file  is  created  with  the  given  filepath.)

Upon  running  the  app,  the  user  can  interact  with  the  program  using  the  options  presented  at  the  main  menu  screen to  print  the  list,  add/remove  items,  save changes to the list, and exit the program.
