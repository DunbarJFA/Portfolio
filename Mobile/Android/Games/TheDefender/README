Things of note for a first-time player:

The cooldowns can be a tricky to get used to:
	There are two combat options, Passive and Aggro. Each button gives you
	access to two more options pertaining to your chosen combat style. 
	Where it gets finicky is that the buttons all share the same two 
	spaces in the layout.
The combat is a little too fast-paced. Definitely not fully balanced. 

No bugs!! (That I've found.)

LUCK ONLY MATTERS IN HORSESHOES AND HANDGRENADES!!! (Really, it doesn't do
 	anything yet, don't waste your skill points on it.) The plan is to 
	implement other enemies and a drop system based on your luck attribute
	and to incorporate luck into combat. Gonna work on that next. 

I really enjoyed this assignment (spent basically every minute since I emailed
you working on it), so thanks for giving it to us. This is a bit of a rush 
job, so I didn't get to everything that I wanted (like the unfinished Luck
 feature, incomplete beautification, and lack of sound), but I plan to keep
 working on polishing this thing. I had no idea mobile app dev would be this
 fun. Really glad I'm in the class.

All best,

Jerod
