# Portfolio
This portfolio is a collection of my work since starting my Computer Science 
education at the University of New Orleans in the Fall of 2016.

You'll find it subdivided according to the language or technology used for each 
set of projects.

This is a living, evolving repository, so if there is nothing here that you find interesting 
at the moment, I hope that you will come back and look again sometime. One way or
the other, thank you for stopping by!

All best,

Jerod
