# Portfolio
This portfolio is a collection of the work that I have done since starting my 
Computer Science education at the University of New Orleans in the Fall of 2016.

You'll find it subdivided according to the language in which each set of projects
is written.

It is intended to be an ongoing project, so if there is nothing here that you find
interesting now, I hope that you will come back and look again sometime. One way or
the other, thank you for stopping by! I hope you find it worth your time!

All best,

Jerod
