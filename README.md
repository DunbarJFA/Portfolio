# Portfolio
This is a collection of my work since starting my Computer Science Master's degree 
program at the University of New Orleans in the Fall of 2017.

You'll find it subdivided firstly according to language or discipline, then according
to a more specific breakdown of the tools or technologies used.

This is a living, evolving repository. The structure may change from time to time 
and new projects will be added upon completion. If there is nothing here that you find 
interesting at the moment, I hope that you will come back and look again sometime. 
Thank you for stopping by!

All best,

Jerod
