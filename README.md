# Portfolio
This is a collection of my work since starting my Computer Science Masters degree 
program at the University of New Orleans in the Fall of 2017.

You'll find it subdivided first according to the language or technology used, then
according to a more specific breakdown of the tools or areas of study examined through
each respective project or group of projects.

This is a living, evolving repository. The organization may change from time to time 
and new projects will be added upon completion. If there is nothing here that you find 
interesting at the moment, I hope that you will come back and look again sometime. 
One way or the other, thank you for stopping by!

All best,

Jerod
